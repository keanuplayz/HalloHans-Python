## Installing
Installing can be done with the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt``` or ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

Then use the CLI by executing `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`.

*(Note: The `pip` command depends on your installed Python version. Python 3.x and beyond uses `pip3`, anything lower uses `pip`.)*

## Building an exe
To build the `.exe` file, use `pyinstaller`.

The process is as following:

1. ```git clone https://github.com/keanuplayz/IT-Python/edit/master/README.md```

2. ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` or ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

3. ```pyinstaller main.py```

This will build the `.exe` file for the CLI.

*(Note: adding the `.exe` folder to your `$PATH` variable allows you to use the CLI globally.)*
